Stubborn attachments:
1. Minimize the use of SHIFT key
2. Minimize useless indentation
3. Useful, minimal, elegant (in that order)
4. Model programs as data, and functions that transform data
5. "What do I need here?" beats "what, philosophically, is this thing?"
6. Nominal data types, structural interfaces
7. Interfaces (protocols) should be rare
8. Discourage being nerd-sniped
9. Clearly label mutation and blocking
